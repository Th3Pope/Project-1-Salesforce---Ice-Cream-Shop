# I-Heart-Ice-Cream

## Project Description
I-Heart-Ice-Cream is a Salesforce demo site with two AGILE iterations. The first utilizes Visualforce pages while the second is a revamp using Aura Components.

## Technologies Used
- Salesforce scratch orgs
- VSCode with SFDX extensions
- Git and GitHub


## Features
List of features ready and TODOs for future development
- Apex controllers for managing server-side data and computations.
- Visualforce pages for order menus, allergy information, popular flavor rankings, and job applications.
- Aura components that build off of the previous Visualforce pages and produce a cleaner site.

To-do list:
- Unit testing needs to be updated to fit our latest changes and additions.
- The customer support portal currently has a bug where cases submitted by customers are not logged to our Salesforce organization.

## Getting Started
1. First, use the following link to clone our GitHub repository and Salesforce files: https://github.com/Th3Pope/Project-1-Salesforce---Ice-Cream-Shop.git

2. If not already present on your system, install VSCode (or another editor of your choice) that supports an SFDX plugin.  

3. Create a scratch org based of the shape defined by config/project-scratch-def.json. An official video tutorial from Salesforce support can be found [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=29C1TJTWauo) regarding how to do this.
